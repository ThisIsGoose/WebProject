  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>As a life-long metalhead and appreciator of music, I needed a space to share my thoughts and opinions on the world of metal. I created this website to provide a platform, and I hope that you will enjoy reading my takes and listening along as you form your own personal opinions.</p>
  <!-- To facilitate a more intuitive design, I have incorparated a link within the following paragraph. -->
  <p>This is not a website for objective reviews of the albums posted, but I try my best to minimize any biases I have to deliver the best possible reviews for the albums I've been listening to. If you wish to share your own opinions, feel free to contact me via the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
